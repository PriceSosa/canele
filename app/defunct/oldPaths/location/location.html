		<h2>Say What?</h2>
		
		<p>Our namesake is pronounced "cah·nah·lay," although the chef sometimes jokingly says "can·nel·lo·ni." Don't let her fool you. Our moniker comes from a luscious little molded dessert originally from Bordeaux.</p>

		<p>Some refer to it as a baked custard or a cake, but this doesn't do justice to the unique character of canelé. Like so many wonders of baking, the ingredients are simple: milk, flour, butter, sugar, and eggs, but the process is complex. The batter must rest for a full 24 hours and is a temperamental beast. But when the stars are aligned and the cook has had plenty of practice, it produces two, maybe three bites of sweet perfection—chewy, crunchy, and tender all at once.</p>

		<h2>But Why?</h2>

		<p>We named our restaurant after this sweet treat because we hope that our little place will have a similar greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts effect. We shop at local farmer’s markets, seeking food that is direct, simple, comforting, but irresistibly tasty. We’ve built the dining room to be welcoming and unpretentious, and we do our best to serve you in that same spirit. We hope that these elements, when the stars align and we’re on top of our game, will create a dining experience as satisfying, even as wondrous, as our namesake. Come on by, and we’ll give you a taste of both.</p>
