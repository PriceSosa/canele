	<p>As is immediately apparent by our seasonally driven menus, we are regulars at the local farmer's markets around Los Angeles. Our weekly stops: Wednesday in Santa Monica, Saturday in Silver Lake, and Sunday in Hollywood and at our very own Atwater Village market. If you see chef Corina and/or her crew (they'll be the ones with the dolly and big crates full of fresh, organic produce), say hi!</p>

	<p>Our favorite place to see and speak with you? Right here at 3219 Glendale Blvd. Come by! Need directions on getting here? <a ng-click="goToDiretions()">Click me!</a>
