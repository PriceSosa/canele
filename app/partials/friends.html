<h2 style="padding-bottom: 10px;">We're so lucky to have such great friends.</h2>

<p>Every so often on a Tuesday night we share our kitchen with some special folks for our popular "friends cook at canel√©." These pals, ranging from exprienced chefs to absolute newbies, conceive, prep, and cook to order a 3 course prix-fixe menu with the advice and assistance of our chef, cooks, and servers.</p>

<p>Who are these brave guest chefs? They are friends so in love with cooking they must replicate their most recent home-kitchen triumph on a vast scale. They are friends who love to eat and want to share their childhood gustatory obsession. The sort of friend who stays up all night watching food shows and then spends the next day researching where to buy duck gizzards or fresh cardoons.</p>

<p>Maybe it's somebody like you?</p>
